<P>
Currently CyberBoard is provided for use free-of-charge. Some people
have suggested that I make it available as Shareware but I'd rather
not do this. Unfortunately, developing software like CyberBoard is 
not expense free: development software, computer, Internet access, and 
so on. To help defray some of this expense I'm going to try a 
compromise approach to help fund this work.</P>
<P>
CyberBoard will remain free of charge. However, if CyberBoard has proven 
to be a valuable tool for your board gaming activities, please 
consider making a donation. I've set up a PayPal account that makes 
contributing a near painless process. Just click the button below.</P>
